A terminal snake game written in Rust with the use of pancurses.
It's supposed to be equal feature-wise to my [C++ snake](https://github.com/GOKOP/snake) but isn't yet.

Stuff that the other snake currently does and this one doesn't:
- config through command line options

Stuff that I want to make but neither snake has it yet:
- config through an in-game menu
- p2p multiplayer (yeah I know multiplayer snake is a great idea)
